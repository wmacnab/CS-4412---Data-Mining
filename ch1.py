"""
When writing scrapers, it’s important to think about the overall pattern of your code
in order to handle exceptions and make it readable at the same time. You’ll also likely
want to heavily reuse code. Having generic functions such as getSiteHTML and
getTitle (complete with thorough exception handling) makes it easy to quickly—
and reliably—scrape the web.
